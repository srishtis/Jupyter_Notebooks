The results indicate similar richness of vocabulary. This should not be surprising as they are all nobel prize winning papers.\n1. wc: This is the wordcount by each category. Please note that the stop words have already been treated for. These are lemmatized key words. Higher the value, richer is the vocabulary.\n2. Shannon index: It is one of the probabilistic indices that quantifies the diversity of the text based on the log of probabilities (or proportions). More different characters (words) there are, and the more equal their proportional abundances in the string of interest, the more difficult it is to correctly predict which word will be the next one in the string. Higher the Shannon Index, higher the diversity.\n3. Simpson Index: Simpson's index is a similarity index (the higher the value the lower in diversity). If you want to use it as a diversity index you can subtract it to 1 (i.e. 1-Simpson Index). Moreover, Simpson index is more weighted on dominant words (higher weightage to more frequent words).\n4. Berger Parker Index: The Berger–Parker index equals the maximum probability value in the dataset, i.e. the proportional abundance of the most abundant word. This is also a weighted measure by probability.\n5. Collision Entropy: Also known as Renyi entropy, this is a generalized case of probabilitic information content. HIgher the collision entropy, higher is the word diversity.\n6. Brillouin index: It is similar to Shannon Index but gives the diversity score in the population versus the sample. \n\nThus, Physics has the highest word count- thus the most distinct words in the paper are for the category Physics. The most diverse set of words are used by Literature papers according to the highest Shannon Index and the highest collision entropy."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pol <- polarity(motivation$lemm_words, motivation$Category)\nplot(pol)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sentiment or polarity can be studied by categories.
